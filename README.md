# LaTeef
A customizable and automated chordal jazz voice-leading engine.

Create MIDI chord progressions with smooth algorithmic voice leading!

# Installation:

clone the repo, and cd to it

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then you can run...

`python LaTeef`

and we should be up and running!

## Create chord progressions with the touch of a button as smoothly and customizably as possible.

LaTeef allows for customization of: 
* Tension levels (7, 9, or 11/13 chords)
* Chord senority (minor, major, or dominant)
* Root (all 12-tone chromatic notes) 
 
_Inversions are automatically applied algorithmically based off of the current chordal state (sequence of chords that preceeded the current chord)._
**
Exporting to MIDI means that you can load it in on any software instrument you could want!**
